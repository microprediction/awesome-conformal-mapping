# awesome-conformal-mapping


There are several good code packages that can be used for conformal mapping. Some of the most popular and widely used options include:

S-PLUS: S-PLUS is a statistical software package that includes a wide range of tools for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. It has a built-in conformal mapping function that allows users to easily map complex functions onto simple domains.

Matlab: Matlab is a popular technical computing platform that is widely used in engineering and scientific applications. It includes a number of functions for conformal mapping, including the Moebius and Schwarz-Christoffel transformations.

Python: Python is a popular programming language that has a wide range of applications in science and engineering. There are several libraries and packages available for Python that can be used for conformal mapping, including NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy.

Maple: Maple is a mathematical software package that is widely used in education and research. It includes a number of tools for conformal mapping, including the Moebius and Riemann mappings.

R: R is a popular programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It includes a number of packages that can be used for conformal mapping, such as the Mapping and Spatial packages.

Overall, the best code package for conformal mapping will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user. Some factors to consider when choosing a code package for conformal mapping include the availability of built-in functions and tools, the user-friendliness of the software, and the compatibility with other software and tools that may be used in conjunction with conformal mapping.
